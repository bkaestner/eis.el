#+TITLE: Emacs Introspection System

This package provides an alternative to the overviews of =describe-variable='s, =describe-defun='s and =describe-face='s completing read menu.
* Motivation
Back in Feburary 2022, a fellow Emacs user asked the following question:
#+begin_quote
How do I check currently used elements in Emacs?
As in, what's the currently used font, frame settings, colours, language, system, etc etc?
#+end_quote
A mixture of [[https://xkcd.com/356/][XKCD:356]] and [[https://xkcd.com/456/][XKCD:456]] later, here's the *Emacs Introspection System*, a collection of major modes based on ~tabulated-list-mode~.

* Usage
Install the package and then use  ~eis-show-faces~, ~eis-show-fonts~, ~eis-show-functions~ or  ~eis-show-variables~.
